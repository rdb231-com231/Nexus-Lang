# How to Install and Run Nexus?

### Installation
Install the content present in this repo:
REQUIRED FILES/DIRECTORIES:
- Interpreter [Directory]
- nexus_cli.py [file]

The Documentation and README.md are optional.
Unzip if necessary and place the Nexus-Lang on folder that you will run all of your's nexus code.
use in the command line:
```bash
$ cd NexusLang
```
Install the Nexus Language Support extension if you're using VS Code.

---
## Running
Create a `main.nxs` file in the directory (__NOT__ inside the nexus-lang directory)
<br>
Type in any code necessary into the _file_, then run:

```bash
$ py nexus_cli.py
```
This will initialize the ***Nexus `CLI`***, which will be responsible for *running* your file.
```bash
$ Welcome to the Nexus Shell! Please, do: nexus <filename>
```

> You can run the file without or with implementing the `.nxs` extension at the CLI (necessary in the file)
>> Remember to use `../` at the CLI if your file is outside of the `NexusLang` file.

```bash
$ >> nexus main
```

***OR***

```bash
$ >> nexus main.nxs
```

### Note From The Creator
> Hi! Name's MewPlush. I created Nexus as a **project** only that does not have relation to grade or any serious bussiness.
> I would love to see some editing my code (which is pretty not mine -- as I followed CodePulse tutorial), or maybe even trying to do something crazy with the language. Or just using it in general!
> Thank you all for reading and maybe downloading Nexus, I'm open for any change, I really don't mind accepting new code into this project. Feel free to participate! If you want to contribute or something, reach me on discord: @mew.plush 
> Thank you all again! :)

*EXPECT* ***BUGS***, specially from **GEN1**. Please, do not forget to check CodePulse channel!
